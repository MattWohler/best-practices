# PHP Coding Standards

Style and indentations should follow the agreed upon PSR's:
 - [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
 - [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)

We follow 3 motto's:
  - Keep it simple, stupid. ( KISS )
  - Don't Repeat Yourself ( DRY )
  - Single Responsibility Principe ( SRP )
  
To help following these motto, we enforce the following rules from the [Object Calisthenics](https://github.com/TheLadders/object-calisthenics)
  - One level of indentation per method
  - Do not use the ``else`` keyword
  - Do not abbreviate

Other rules are encouraged but not forced upon for simplicity.

# Javascript Coding Standard

 - PHP PSR's make sense and apply.
 - Same Object Calisthenics apply.

## AngularJS Best Practice
 - ``ng-app`` should be in ``<body>``
 - The app should be the mothership holding all submodules
````javascript

````
